# Reinforcement-Learning-Fundamentals
Fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms written in MATLAB
These algorithms were developed for my website "How to Reinforcement Learning". They are meant to help me and others understand the basic algorithms underlying reinforcement learning theory. The end goal is to get into deep RL.
